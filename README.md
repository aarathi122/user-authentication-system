The output of the application is a basic user authentication system using Passport.js with local strategy and session management. It includes a registration page where users can create an account with a username and password, a login page for authentication, and a protected dashboard page that only logged-in users can access. Users can also log out, ending their session and redirecting them to the login page. The app runs on http://localhost:3000 and handles simple session-based authentication without password encryption like bcrypt
